# **Python based Keylogger**   

## DISCLAIMER: DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN SYSTEM OR A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT WITH PERMISSION. USING THIS FOR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES IS VERY BAD :(

## **Version 1.0**  

### *Basic keylogger, records inputs by user and writes them to a file created by the program*
### Ways to improve:
- #### Hide file better
- #### Don't rewrite file everytime a special key is pressed
- #### Also work to track clipboard
- #### Hide within a larger system and call file to run when program is launched
- #### Encrypt code so end user can't easily find what it does
- #### Upload input file to server with naming convention to be unique to user who is infected
