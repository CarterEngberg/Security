# **Making a Keylogger using Python**   
**Technologies Used**: *Python*  

---

## **Project Overview**  

- *This project is meant to familiarize myself with the basics of keyloggers. A quiet but deadly kind of attack where inputs are recorded and saved to a file, typically hidden to the person who is being attacked. This keylogger is not to be used by anyone without explicit consent of the owner of the machine.*
